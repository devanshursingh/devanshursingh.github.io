      Hi! My name is Devanshu Singh. I am an Indian-American young professional and freelance tutor living in Seattle.
With a background in data science as well as writing-heavy research, I am perfectly suited to tutor bright, ambitious middle-school and high-school students who want to put in that extra effort beyond what is required to maximize their academic growth. 
I am currently a graduate student and Teaching Assistant at the University of Washington in Political Science, where I teach sections in classes heavily focused on writing. Previously, I worked as a data scientist at c4ads.org, where I investigated illicit networks in international affairs using modern data science techniques. Before embarking on my career, I received my Master’s of Science in Engineering degree at Johns Hopkins University, which I also fondly remember as my undergrad launching pad. In my free time, I really enjoy great storytelling in any form, from the Mahabharata to The Dark Knight Rises, love spending time with my friends, and exploring my new home city of Seattle.
With these experiences, I am looking to tutor students in topics ranging from math and programming, to writing, SAT prep, and college and school applications, including others. I am especially familiar with the challenges of teaching students how to write well in the era of ChatGPT, and I firmly believe that knowing how to write well is equivalent to knowing how to think. I am also confident that teaching math can be enjoyable for students if approached in the right way. Finally, having been through applications for competitive schools and colleges myself, I am familiar with the academic and personal challenges of that early journey, and I am confident I can help guide students along the way.
While I cannot guarantee any outcomes in exams or application results, working with me will significantly advance your student’s progress in those goals. I charge $100/hour and I can adapt my schedule to fit your student’s needs, whether that means a weekly session or multiple sessions a week. If you are interested in booking me, please email me at dsingh33@alumni.jh.edu or text me at (310)904-9357. I can take payments either through Venmo, Zelle, direct deposit, or check, depending on your preferences.
I love teaching students and giving them a love of learning and the rewards of effort, and I look forward to doing the same with your student!
